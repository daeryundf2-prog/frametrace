# Reproducible Build & Release Procedure

This document is the release checklist for FrameTrace binaries: how the
released artifact is built, how its integrity is anchored (SHA256SUMS +
optional signature), how to emit an SBOM, and how to build from a vendored
source tree. It is procedure, not new infrastructure — the only code added
is `scripts/build-release.sh` (Unix) and the SHA256SUMS step in
`scripts/make-portable.ps1` (Windows).

## Inputs that decide the build

| Input | Where pinned |
| --- | --- |
| Rust toolchain | `rust-toolchain.toml` — channel `1.94.0`, components `clippy`, `rustfmt` |
| Dependency graph | `Cargo.lock` — every build command below passes `--locked` |
| Compiler/target | `rustc -vV` host triple, baked into the artifact name |

Rebuilding a release means: same pinned toolchain, same lockfile, same
target. FrameTrace does **not** currently assert bit-for-bit
reproducibility across machines or toolchain builds — the published
SHA-256 manifest plus a signature is the integrity anchor, not a
rebuild-everywhere guarantee. If byte-identical rebuilds become a
requirement, the first gaps to close are documented below under
"Caveats".

## Building a release

```sh
scripts/build-release.sh            # zip + SHA256SUMS
scripts/build-release.sh --sbom     # + CycloneDX SBOM (needs cargo-sbom)
scripts/build-release.sh --sign     # + cosign sign-blob bundles
```

produces:

```
dist/frametrace-<version>-<target>.zip
dist/SHA256SUMS                     # covers every zip in dist/
```

On Windows, `scripts/make-portable.ps1` already stages the portable
layout (`tools/bin` for external tools); it now also writes
`dist/SHA256SUMS` with the same `sha256sum -c`-compatible format.

## Verifying a release

```sh
cd dist
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS             # or: shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
```

With a cosign bundle produced by `--sign`:

```sh
cosign verify-blob --bundle frametrace-<ver>-<target>.zip.sigstore.json \
    --certificate-identity <release-identity> \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
    frametrace-<ver>-<target>.zip
```

For releases cut on GitHub Actions, prefer artifact attestation over raw
cosign: add `actions/attest-build-provenance@v2` to the release workflow
and consumers verify with `gh attestation verify frametrace-<ver>-<target>.zip
--repo <org>/<repo>`. Both options are documented alternatives; neither is
required to produce the zip + SHA256SUMS baseline.

## SBOM

`cargo-sbom` is the reasonable choice: maintained, emits CycloneDX JSON,
walks `Cargo.lock` so it documents exactly what `--locked` built:

```sh
cargo install cargo-sbom --locked
cargo sbom > dist/frametrace-<ver>-<target>.sbom.cyclonedx.json
```

The `--sbom` flag of `build-release.sh` does exactly this. A lighter
fallback when cargo-sbom cannot be installed: `cargo tree --locked
--format "{p}"` enumerates the resolved dependency graph — less
structured than CycloneDX, but sufficient for an examiner to diff two
builds' inputs.

## Vendored (offline) build

For air-gapped or archive-preservation builds:

```sh
cargo vendor --locked vendor/ > vendor-config.toml
# append vendor-config.toml to .cargo/config.toml, then:
cargo build --release --locked --offline
```

Commit or archive `vendor/` + `Cargo.lock` + `rust-toolchain.toml`
alongside the release record; that triplet is the complete build input.

## Publication practice

1. Cut the release from a clean `main` checkout (`git status` empty).
2. Run `scripts/build-release.sh --sbom --sign` per platform (or the
   `.ps1` equivalent on Windows).
3. Publish the zips, `SHA256SUMS`, the `.sigstore.json` bundles (or the
   GitHub attestation), and the SBOMs together — the manifest is only
   trustworthy when its signature travels with it.
4. Record the expected binary SHA-256 in the release notes themselves so
   a consumer who never fetches dist/ can still compare a hash quoted in
   release text against a downloaded binary.

## Caveats

- **Not bit-for-bit reproducible yet.** `rustc` embeds path-dependent
  and occasionally nondeterministic metadata; same toolchain + lockfile
  on the same target *should* converge, but nobody has run the two-machine
  comparison. `qa consistency` (in-repo) is the pragmatic check today:
  same inputs → same outputs at the *product* level.
- **SBOM covers the Rust crate graph only.** Runtime external tools
  (ffmpeg, libewf, Sleuth Kit) are out-of-process and belong in the
  examiner's environment manifest, not the crate SBOM.
- **SHA256SUMS is self-asserted.** It anchors integrity only when the
  signature/attestation over it is verified; an unsigned manifest proves
  nothing about who produced it.
